												<h3>Why was the East Side chosen as the focus of the study?</h3>
												<p>
													While the research team is open to accepting participants from other parts of the city, the East 
													Side was chosen as the primary focus because of the high rates of asthma in the area. Asthma rates 
													are especially high among African American children: the asthma hospitalization rate per 10,000 of 
													Black youth is 46.9, compared to 10.2 for white youth. The localized air quality measurements that 
													this study seeks to collect are therefore needed to definitively link childhood asthma with exposure 
													to air pollution on the East Side.
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>What is being measured? And how?</h3>
												<p>
													The monitors will measure the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds 
													(VOC) in the air. The sensors are called “PurpleAir” and would be installed by the research team 
													outside your home for an extended period. 
												</p>
											</section>

											<section>
												<h3>What is needed to participate?</h3>
												<p>
													The PurpleAir sensors only need a wifi network and an outdoor power outlet. The research team will 
													need to check on the sensors 6-8 times per year, but will not need to access your home. Though power 
													is needed to run the sensors, the electric cost is only $1 per year. Participants will receive access 
													to real-time air quality data outside their home, via an app connected to the PurpleAir sensors.
												</p>

											<section>
												<h3>Is this study directly affiliated with the Kensington Expressway project?</h3>
												<p>
													While environmental factors such as highways contribute to air pollution, this study is not affiliated 
													with the New York State Department of Transportation’s expressway project.  
												</p>
