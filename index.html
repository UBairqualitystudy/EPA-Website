													<h3>What is the goal of the study?</h3>
													<p>
														Air quality is currently monitored at three EPA monitoring sites at the edges of the city  – 
														represented by red dots on the adjacent map. Given their location, these sites do not provide 
														the most accurate air quality data for city residents. This study takes a community-based approach 
														to data collection in areas with high rates of asthma (outlined in yellow) to provide residents 
														with accurate real-time air quality information. 
													</p>
												</section>
												<section>
													<h3>Why was the East Side chosen as the focus of the study?</h3>
													<p>
														While the research team is open to accepting participants from other parts of the city, the East 
														Side was chosen as the primary focus because of the high rates of asthma in the area. Asthma rates 
														are especially high among African American children: the asthma hospitalization rate per 10,000 of 
														Black youth is 46.9, compared to 10.2 for white youth. The localized air quality measurements that 
														this study seeks to collect are therefore needed to definitively link childhood asthma with exposure 
														to air pollution on the East Side.
													</p>

													<h3>Why participate?</h3>
													<p>
														Hosting an air monitor outside your home, business, or church provides you with an opportunity to 
														better understand the air quality in your neighborhood. Accurate air quality information could help 
														you plan outdoor activities safely if you or someone you know has asthma, COPD, or any other respiratory illness.
